   #Analytics
   The mai purpose of the analytics sections is to allow the user to have to their disposal a way to understand how their shelter or
   restaurant is performing with the help of Plate Beacon. To accomplish this goal the Analytics section provides functionality which has
   been developed specifically for each type of user.

   As a restaurant user they will have three types of functionality: Earnings, Rating, and Savings. Saving feature main implementation
   consist of a graphical chart which will display data with regards to the overall savings gained with the use of Plate Beacon.
   Further in, the user will have the option to view this data into three main categories: Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly. To accomplish
   this the user will have to their disposal three bottoms on top of the graph which they can interact with to shift between the three previously
   mentioned categories. The ranking section main functionality allows the user to view where they stand in terms of food donation between the
   restaurant forming plate beacon network. The purpose of this section is to motivate competition between restaurant. The last feature is the
   earnings, this feature implementation is similar to the one found in the saving functionality. It's main purpose is to allow the user to
   have a graphical representation of the earning that the restaurant is making through out the Plate Beacon app. This is a future implementation
   which aims to find a way to make Plate Beacon more appealing.

   The Shelter analytics sections functionality is very similar to the one found in the restaurant. The user will have to their disposal three main
   functions: Food Donations, Top Contributors, and Food Request. Food Donations main functionality consist a graphical representation of the amount
   of donations that have being received so far. The chart can be updated in a matter that it will display data in a weekly, monthly, or yearly. This update
   can be performed by the user with the three available bottoms on top of the chart. Top Contributors main functionality consist in displaying an
   ordered list from top to button with information in regards to which restaurant has donated more to their shelter. The objective is to allow
   the user to have an understanding of the type of donations that are most likely to get. The last functionality is the Food Request, in terms of
   implementation this feature is similar to the one found in the Food Donations. It's main purpose is to provide the user with a graphical
   representation of the type of food that is being consumed the most at their respective shelter. With this the user will be able to more easily
   understand which types of products are beings consumed at that specific location.
